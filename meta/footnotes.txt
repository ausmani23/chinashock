###fig_incrates
This figure shows the national-level incarceration rate in the United States over recent decades. We define the incarceration rate as the number of state prisoners and jail inmates per every 100,000 adults (i.e., those aged 15 to 64). The long-dashed line plots figures from widely available national-level data, while the solid line plots the population-weighted average incarceration rate calculated from those commuting zones for which we have data. The short-dashed line plots the same estimate, but from commuting zones which are in our regression sample (i.e., for which we have data on all relevant covariates). While the figure shows that these last two measures are not unbiased estimates of the national-level incarceration rate -- in earlier years they slightly overestimate it, and in latter years they underestimate it --- they trend in similar ways, and in similar directions. While there is no way to be sure without collecting better data, we have no reason to suspect that our sample would yield biased estimates of the parameters of interest in this paper. 
###fig_ols2sls
This figure contrasts estimates derived from OLS to estimates derived from regressions in which we use the China Shock to instrument for each of the three endogenous variables we use. As the results illustrate, by ordinary OLS, are estimates are statistically indistinguishable from zero. On the other hand, all 2SLS estimates are positive and punitively remarkably large: a standard deviation deterioration of the labor market is estimated to increase the incarceration rate by anywhere from 9\% (when we instrument for the manufacturing share) to 34\% (when we instrument for the unemployment rate). Note that we discuss the issue of effect size in more detail in Section \ref{cfactuals} of the paper. Whichever measure of labor market deterioration we use, our estimate is statistically significant at $\alpha=0.01$.
###fig_groupests
This figure plots the estimated impact of a standard deviation deterioration in the labor market on group-specific incarceration rates, again for each of our three endogenous variables. In all cases, estimates are positive, and with one exception, all but the Latino/a incarceration rate is statistically noteworthy at conventional levels of significance ($\alpha=0.10$ in a two-sided test). Moreover, the insignificance of this latter estimate may just reflect the diminished power of our approach: both because of missing data and settlement patterns, analysis of Latino/a incarceration is limited to 172 observations in 112 commuting zones (compared to a sample of 800 observations in 445 commuting zones for the overall incarceration rate). Future work, armed with better data or clearer hypotheses, might make more of these group-level differences than we do here. 
###fig_robests
This figure plots results from a variety of additional specifications and robustness tests. We find that are results are generally robust to reasonable alternatives, but for a fuller discussion of these results and what they imply, see Section \ref{results_robustness} in the main paper. 
###fig_densities
This figure plots the distribution of our three endogenous variables (in our regression sample), in order to give some sense of what a 20th and 80th percentile deterioration implies in each case and in each period. As we explain in Section \ref{cfactuals}, these are the values we use when estimating incarceration rates under the relevant counterfactuals. Note that the manufacturing share is in decline in most commuting zones in both of these periods, whereas trends in the other two endogenous variables are different. In general, these indicators show an improving labor market in the 1990s but a deteriorating one in the 2000s. This motivates the additional counterfactual we examine, in which we examine the rate of incarceration in a United States in which the 1990s boom continued into the 2000s. 
###fig_cfactuals_rates
This figure shows counterfactual rates of incarceration under three scenarios: the solid line plots the predicted incarceration rate when variables are held at their observed values, the short-dashed line plots the population-weighted average incarceration rate when it is held at its 80th percentile value in each period (implying a relatively unhealthy labor market), and the long-dashed line plots the population-weighted average in a US in which labor markets in the 2000s were no different from labor markets in the 1990s. We discuss these results in Section \ref{cfactuals}. 
###fig_cfactuals_stats
This figure quantifies the counterfactual increases or decreases shown in Figure \ref{fig_cfactuals_rates}. The bars indicate 95\% confidence intervals for these estimated increases or decreases; the $\alpha$ values indicate whether the 90\%, 95\%, or 99\% confidence intervals cross zero. These results illustrate that our estimates are not just statistically but also punitively remarkably significant. See Section \ref{cfactuals} for more details.
###fig_sample
This figure plots the commuting zones in our regression sample (see also Figure \ref{fig_missing_map}). As is evident, coverage is highly variable across states: in some states we have data covering all commuting zones, while in others we have none. This is due to inconsistencies and errors in how some states report data to the National Corrections Reporting Program.
###fig_1sests
This figure plots results from first-stage diagnostic tests (i.e., where the null is that the instrument is weak). As the graph suggests, all of our endogenous strategies pass muster --- this is not surprising, given that this paper implements strategies that have been used in past, published work. The F-statistic from this first-stage test is written directly on the graph. We plot the second-stage results alongside, for reference.
###tab_reg_maintable
This table presents results from our preferred specifications, contrasting estimates obtained from ordinary OLS to estimates from 2SLS. As we describe in Section \ref{methods}, these are first-difference regressions stacked over two time periods (1991-1999, and 1999-2011), which means that the endogenous and dependent variables are first-differenced, while the start-of-period controls are measures of the level of the given variable in the initial year of the period (i.e., 1991 or 1999). 
###tab_reg_manuf
This table presents results from regressions in which we use a decline in the manufacturing share of employment as our key endogenous variable. As we describe in Section \ref{methods}, these are first-difference regressions stacked over two time periods (1991-1999, and 1999-2011). Column (1) is a specification which includes division-level fixed-effects, period-level fixed-effects, and the endogenous variable only. Column (2) adds a set of controls; we consider this our preferred specification. Column (3) is the same, but shows the OLS rather than 2SLS estimates. Finally, Column (4) adds a set of further controls. 
###tab_reg_emptopop
This table presents results from regressions in which we use a decline in the employment to population ratio as our key endogenous variable. Otherwise, the columns denote the same models (in the same order) described in Table \ref{tab_reg_manuf}.
###tab_reg_unemp
This table presents results from regressions in which we use the increase in the unemployment rate as our key endogenous variable. Otherwise, the columns denote the same models (in the same order) described in Table \ref{tab_reg_manuf}.
###fig_missing_map
This figure displays the commuting zones that are missing from our sample of the total (prison and jail) incarceration rates in each of the two periods under study. In almost all cases missingness is due to an absence of state prisoner data for the respective commuting zone for one or both of the years that begin and end each period. 
###fig_chinashock_map
These maps display quintiles of Autor et al's measure of the china shock at the commuting zone level for 1990-1999 and 1999-2011. This is a weighted average of industry-specific Chinese imports multiplied by local employment shares. The shape file of 1990 commuting zones was kindly shared by Michael Stepner.
###fig_chinashock_overseas_map
These maps display quintiles of Autor et al's instrument for the china shock at the commuting zone level for 1990-1999 and 1999-2011. It is a weighted average of industry-specific Chinese imports to non_US countries multiplied by local employment shares in those industries. 
###fig_emp2pop_map
These maps display quintiles of the change in the employment to population ratio for 1990-1999 and 1999-2011 by commuting zone. The employment to population ratio is one of three endogenous variables examined in this article. 
###fig_manushare_map
These maps display quintiles of the change in the manufacturing share of employment for 1990-1999 and 1999-2011. The manufacturing share is one of three endogenous variables examined in this article.
###fig_unemployment_map
These maps display quintiles of the change in the unemployment rate for 1990-1999 and 1999-2011. The unemployment rate is one of three endogenous variables examined in this article. 
###fig_imprisonment_map
These maps display quintiles of the change in the total (jail plus prison) incarceration rate for 1990-1999 and 1999-2011. The incarceration rate is our primary dependent variable. In most cases missingness is due to an absence of state prisoner data for the respective commuting zone for one or both of the years that begin and end each period.
