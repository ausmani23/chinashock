###fig_inclm_corrs
This figure illustrates the national-level correlation between the incarceration rate, and two key labor market indicators: the employment-to-population ratio and the unemployment rate. All variables are normalized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 over the period in question. The employment-to-population ratio is positively correlated with the incarceration rate, while the unemployment rate is negatively correlated. Though neither correlation is statistically significant, on their own both imply a surprising conclusion: over the last thirty years, incarceration has been higher when labor markets have been healthier. 

###fig_path
This figure (a Directed Acyclic Graph [DAG]) illustrates our reasoning for conditioning on some but not all observable properties of commuting zones. We control for those features of commuting zones which are correlated with the influx of Chinese imports over a given period and which could plausibly cause changes in the incarceration rate for reasons unrelated to our causal channel of interest. As illustrated here, we therefore control for the percentage of a commuting zone that was black on the eve of a shock, but not the share of the commuting zone's labor force concentrated in routinized jobs. 

###fig_incrates
This figure shows the national-level incarceration rate in the United States over recent decades. We define the incarceration rate as the number of state prisoners and jail inmates per every 100,000 adults (i.e., those aged 15 to 64). The long-dashed line plots figures from widely available national-level data, while the solid line plots the population-weighted average incarceration rate calculated from those commuting zones for which we have data. The short-dashed line plots the same estimate, but from commuting zones which are in our regression sample (i.e., for which we have data on all relevant covariates). While the figure shows that these last two measures are not unbiased estimates of the national-level incarceration rate -- in earlier years they slightly overestimate it, and in latter years they underestimate it --- they trend in similar ways, and in similar directions.

###fig_ols2sls
This figure contrasts estimates derived from OLS to estimates derived from regressions in which we use the China Shock to instrument for each of four endogenous measures of labor market health. As the results illustrate, by ordinary OLS, are estimates are statistically indistinguishable from zero. On the other hand, all 2SLS estimates are positive and substantively large. We discuss the issue of effect size in more detail in Section \ref{results_cfactuals} of the paper.

###fig_rffs
This figure shows reduced-form, first-stage and second-stage estimates from regressions in which use the China Shock to instrument for each of four endogneous measures of labor market health. Naturally, the reduced-form estimates are identical across each of the four models, so variation in the second-stage estimates is due to variation at the first stage. See Section \ref{results}.

###fig_effectsbyrace
This figure shows our estimates of the standardized effect of the employment-to-population ratio on race-specific incarceration rates, distinguished by institution (horizontally) and by imputation strategy (vertically). As we explain in the main text, our estimates are positive, but their statistical significance depends substantially on imputing incarceration rates in counties with missing data. We also find some evidence of an effect on jail incarceration (in contrast to our main results), though, because the Vera data do not report double-counted prisoners by race, we caution against reading too much into these results. The dashed red line shows the aggregate (i.e. not race-specific) estimate that corresponds. See Section \ref{results}

###fig_robustness
This figure illustrates the robustness of our main result to a variety of alternative, plausible specifications. The dashed red line indicates our preferred estimate. These are discussed in detail in Section \ref{results_robustness}.

###fig_datachoices
This figure illustrates the robustness of our results to different choices one might make about how to construct our dependent variable. These choices are the result of missingness in the underlying sources, as explained in Section \ref{results_robustness}. 

###fig_otherdvs
This figure plots our estimates of the effect of deteriorating labor markets on other dependent variables. The purpose of this exercise is to gain some insight into the mechanisms by which labor market shocks caused increased incarceration. We discuss our interpretation of these results in Section \ref{results_otherdvs}.  

###fig_densities
This figure plots the distribution of four indicators of labor market health over the two periods that span our analysis. Note that the manufacturing share is in decline in most commuting zones in both of these periods, whereas other indicators suggest an improving labor market in the 1990s but a deteriorating one in the 2000s. This fact supplies the counterfactual we examine in Section \ref{results_cfactuals}. 

###fig_cfactuals_rates
This figure shows counterfactual rates of incarceration in the United States under three scenarios: the short-dashed line plots the observed incarceration rate, the long-dashed line plots the incarceration rate predicted by our model when covariates are held at their observed values, and the solid line plots the incarceration rate if the labor market gains of the 1990s had been preserved into the 2000s. We discuss these results in Section \ref{results_cfactuals}.
 
###fig_sample
This figure plots the commuting zones in our regression sample. As is evident, coverage is highly variable across states: in some states we have data covering all commuting zones, while in others we have none. This is due to inconsistencies and errors in how some states report data to the National Corrections Reporting Program.

###fig_exceptionalism
This figure illustrates two relevant features of American exceptionalism: first, the fact that the US is exceptional in the extent to which it relies on prisons rather than police. Second, the fact that the US is exceptional in the extent to which it relies on penal rather than social spending to control crime. As we discuss in Section \ref{conclusion}, both facts, we argue, can help make sense of the patterns we see in our results. 


###tab_reg_maintable
This table presents results from our preferred specifications, contrasting estimates obtained from ordinary OLS to estimates from 2SLS. As we describe in Section \ref{methods}, these are first-difference regressions stacked over two time periods (1991-1999, and 1999-2011), which means that the endogenous and dependent variables are first-differenced, while the start-of-period controls are measures of the level of the given variable in the initial year of the period (i.e., 1991 or 1999). All models include period-level and state-level fixed effects.
